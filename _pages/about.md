I am a post-doctoral researcher at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge working with [Pantelis Samartsidis](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/staff/pantelis-samartsidis) on developing methods for Bayesian causal inference using time-series observational data.

Previously I was a PhD student at University College London working in the Department of Statistical Science under the supervision of [Samuel Livingstone](https://samueljlivingstone.wixsite.com/webpage) and [Gianluca Baio](https://gianluca.statistica.it/) between 2021-2025. 

My PhD research focuses on two areas: i) Markov Chain Monte Carlo based on Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes with a focus on applications ii) Developing Bayesian survival models in the context of Health Technology Assessment. More generally I am interested in Bayesian computation and modelling, and how these two areas interact.

I have a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics from the University of Warwick, and an MSc in Statistics from University College London. For my MSc dissertation, I was supervised by Samuel Livingstone and worked with Claire Black from UCLH and Federico Ricciardi from UCL Statistical Science developing a Bayesian hierarchical model for predicting levels of exercise intensity in mechanically ventilated Intensive Care patients.
